# Project 1 : Integration of Mergesort & Insertion Sort

Essential Components:

1. Algorithm Implementation
2. Generate Input Data
3. Analyze time complexity
4. Compare with original Mergesort



## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Time Complexity Analysis
